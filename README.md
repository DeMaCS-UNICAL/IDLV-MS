# IDLV-MS
**IDLV+MS** is a new **ASP** system that integrates an efficient grounder, namely [**I-DLV**](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/I-DLV/wiki), with an automatic solver selector: machine-learning techniques are applied for inductively choose the best solver, depending on some inherent features of the instantiation produced by I-DLV. 
I-DLV+MS currently supports the two state-of-the-art ASP solvers [**clasp**](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) and [**wasp**](https://github.com/alviano/wasp)
